# Sinking Carbon

Carbon will be deposited as charcoal from biomasss gasification. The main carbon sinks are 

* agricultural soil (with terra preta/terra preta nova/excrements) 
* areas designated for the purpose (e.g. in Australia)

## Carbon deposits in Australia

To have a tangible effect, the global, annual quantities of deposited charcoal must exceed the quantities of fossil carbon (coal, oil, gas) that is being added to the atmosphere in the same period. I order to guarantee longterm atmospheric carbon removal, the material has to be kept out of reach. Because of the massive scale, this should  happen in a manner that serves addititonal purposes, too. 

Australia has a special interest in tackling it's dryland salinity build-up problem. It's top soil doesn't hold enough water, but charcoal holds about 3 times it's weight in water. Adding massive amounts of charcoal just under the top soil would drastically increase rain water retention and reduce rising ground water tables, decrease the need for irrigation, or deep drainage activities, and support all other means that Australia is undertaking to solve this problem. Increased availability of soil humidity enables regrowth of native and planted vegetation, further balancing the rainfall / runoff / evaporation equation. 

Shipping the vast amounts of globally produced charcoal to a safe deposit should best be done as far as posible by sea transport. Even though the distances are long, shipping of goods over water consumes far less energy than any other means of transport. Australia is located strategically favourable, being more or less equidistant from Africa, Asia, and South America, hence all potential major sources of carbon sequestered as charcoal.
