# The Scale of the Problem

## Global fossil fuel consumption

We consume about <a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/energy/">100 million barrels</a> (รก ~160 litres), or 16 billion liters of crude oil **every day**. The world population is about <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html#xx">8 billion</a>, so the _average_ consumption is roughly 2 liters per capita per day (we'll cover gas and coal later.) The US and China combined consume about 33% of the total, and Europe and Eurasia consume ~20% between them. 

But the vast majority of the world population doesn't consume any fossil fuel at all: Latin Americans consume 4% of the total crude oil (without Brazil), and the almost 1 billion Africans consume about 2% (without Algeria, Egypt and Republic of South Africa). <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf">(BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017)</a>. 

## Global cooking fuel consumption

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1205987">2.8 billion people</a> cook their food on solid fuels like wood, crop residues, dung, charcoal, and coal (and they mostly walk on foot). Because they need to cook their food, and generally use very inefficient cooking methods, they participate to a huge extent in global deforestation... **unless they change their cooking methods**. Gasification of wood is the option to go for, because it is very efficient and has a number of other advantages covered below. 

## Deforestation

Besides all other negative aspects of clearing vegetation, the carbon contained in wood will be metabolized to CO2 by microorganisms, or, more rapidly, by fire. At the current rate, the CO2 from this source contributes by about x % to the total  

Dry wood, on average, consists of about 60% of carbon; most of the rest is hydrogen and oxygen, and smaller quantities of "ash" (minerals).  



## Preventable CO2 formation

We could all walk on foot, and carry our goods, and prevent all emissions from transportation. But that is not the goal here. We want to prevent the looming climate collapse ovide reasonable luxury for all and prevent t
