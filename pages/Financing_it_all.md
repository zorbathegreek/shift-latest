# Financing it all

We want to pay those who bury charcoal from biomass ("biochar"). These will be predominantly African rural women for the foreseeable future. They will produce biochar in gasifiers while they cook, instead of wasting a multitude of fuel wood. 

The ever fluctuating oil price stands at ~50$/barrel (early 2018). The global consumption is ~100 million barrels a day; the industry's turnover is **~$5 billion/day**. 

We propose that the fossil fuel industry add a 20% CO2 removal fee to their product prices (~$1 billion a day), and make these funds available to those who do the clean-up (target: about a billion people @ a dollar a day each); we will be happy to assist directing these funds to those who do the actual "clean-up" and can prove it. All transfer records will we published. To keep it simple, we will initially use services like M-Pesa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa) or MobileMoney (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment). Later, we imagine a public community based savings and investment system. 

We might also adopt this example, <a href="https://sardex.net/il-circuito/?lang=en">sardex.net</a>, an innovative European payment tracking system (more recent updates <a href="https://sardex.net/il-circuito/">here<a/>). 

Until that happens, we would be happy if *YOU* could decide to start contributing. Register (below, at the bottom of the page), pick a benefitting person at random or at will, anyone from a village, or from an area from (link to database); and send 20% of your petrol expenses; 15% of your airline ticket spendings; 5% of your LPG spendings; or any amount you think is fair to pay women like <a href="(link to video women bulding, cooking, grinding, burying, harvesting,...)">these</a> these . Chose your payment method. We will forward your money and publish (anonymously) where it went. You can call the receiving person for verification if you like. 

In the meantime, we will continue to building the infrastructure to capture CO2, and would like to get your support also in non-financial ways. Please check these (links) to see if you can become part of the solution.


Then transfers will go directly to those who live in undesirable conditions, and are perpetually targeted by "development aid". We know how to help them help themselves to get out of their situation (through properly paid work), and are already doing that. The amount we are targeting exceeds all global development assitance by far, and it will be tranferred without the usual overhead losses. 

Above mentioned numbers mean, eventually, that we want to transfer ~$1 billion (20% of ~$5 billion) a day to ~ 1 or ~ billion people, who remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, when they change their ways of cooking on wood and charcoal. They ARE part of the problem but CAN become part of the solution <a href="link-to-gasifier-site">when they change their ways of cooking<a/>.  

There are a number of ways to "sequester" CO2. Many ideas and theories have been published, none has been implemented globally, and the O2 level keeps on rising. But <a href="link-to-gasifier-site">here</a> is one method that works. 


We will keep overhead cost at the absolute minimum. This website is hosted "free" at github.com. We use only Open Source Software which is "free". We have no staff on the payroll and aim to keep it that way. We will not touch your carbon removal payments at all, and cover administration cost via donations. The ones who get paid are those who remove carbon from the atmosphere, and bury it.
