# Financing it all

The ever fluctuating oil price stands at ~50$/barrel (early 2018). The global consumption is ~100 million barrels a day; the industry's turnover is **~$5 billion/day**. 

We propose that the oil, gas, and coal industry add a 20% CO2 removal fee to their product prices, and transfer these funds (~$1 billion a day) to those who do the clean-up; we will be happy to direct these funds to those who do the actual "clean-up" (and can prove it). All transfers will we public, following this example, <a href="https://sardex.net/il-circuito/?lang=en">sardex.net</a>, using an innovative payment tracking technology (more recent updates <a href="https://sardex.net/il-circuito/">here<a/>).

Until that happens, we are building the infrastructure to capture CO2, and would like to get your support. If you consider yourself still a part of the problem, <a href="link">click here</a> to become part of the solution. If you are ready to pay someone to clean up the air after you, you can learn more <a href="link-to-gasifier-site">here<a/>. You can decide how much you would be willing to spend. Say, 20% of what you spend for gasoline/petrol, or power?, <a/ href="link-to-gasifier-site">Click here</a> for examples.

Then transfers will go directly to those who live in undesirable conditions, and are perpetually targeted by "development aid". We know how to help them help themselves to get out of their situation (through properly paid work), and are already doing that. The amount we are targeting exceeds all global development assitance by far, and it will be tranferred without the usual overhead losses. 

Above mentioned numbers mean, eventually, that we want to transfer ~$1 billion (20% of ~$5 billion) a day to ~ 1 or ~ billion people, who remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, when they change their ways of cooking on wood and charcoal. They ARE part of the problem but CAN become part of the solution <a href="link-to-gasifier-site">when they change their ways of cooking<a/>.  

There are a number of ways to "sequester" CO2. Many ideas and theories have been published, none has been implemented globally, and the O2 level keeps on rising. But <a href="link-to-gasifier-site">here</a> is one method that works.
