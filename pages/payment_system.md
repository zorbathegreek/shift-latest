# Payment system 

Funds will generally flow in one direction, worldwide, only towards those who actively remove carbon from the atmosphere (e.g. by burying it) (and who can prove this); a verification system is used to that end, and probably a crypto currency will be used to facilitate transfers into all concerned countries. We might create our own such currency for that purpose later, to prevent speculation and exchange rate losses. For the time bing, we may use something like [World remit](https://www.worldremit.com/en/how-it-works (if only we were that large and successful already...)

We will publish all transactions - for several reasons (though we will anonymize your payments if you wish):

* we want to be transparent.   
* we believe that if this project gathers impact and scale, governments will be interested to tax their citizens' foreign currency income. We will be happy to cooperate and gain their administrational and political support. 
* We do not want to be infiltrated by money launderers or other illegal elements.


Mobile phone coverage and signal strength is generally improving everywhere.
