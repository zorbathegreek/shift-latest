# The Scale of the Problem

## Global fossil fuel consumption

For the sake of simplicity, the following numbers are slightly rounded: the global crude oil consumption is about <a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/energy/">100 million barrels</a> (รก ~160 litres), or 16 billion liters a day. In relation to the world population of about <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html#xx">8 billion</a>, the _average_ daily per capita consumption is about 2 liters per day. 

To break these numbers down, the US and China combined consume about 33% of the total, and Europe and Eurasia combined, ~20%. <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf
">(BP review)</a>. 

But the vast majority of the world population doesn't consume any fossil fuel at all: South and Central America consume 4% of the total (without Brazil), and Africa (population: 1 billion), 2% (without Algeria, Egypt and South Africa), while coincidentally, these countries are suffering the lion's share of the consequences of climate change, like draughts, torrential rains, landslides, typhoons, rising sea levels and the like. 

## Global deforestation

Besides all other negative aspects of clearing vegetation, the contained carbon will be turned to CO2 by microorganisms' metabolism, or, more rapidly, by fire. At the current rate, the CO2 form this source is 

## Preventable CO2 formation

We could all walk on foot, and carry our goods, and prevent all emissions from transportation. But that is not the goal here. We want to prevent the looming climate collapse ovide reasonable luxury for all and prevent t
