# Geo-referencing

You can "claim" and register the area where you bury your charcoal. 

##  How do I geo-reference "my" site?

Find your area <a href="https://plus.codes/">here</a>; mark the areas where you will deposit charcoal, note theirreference numbers, and send a message to "thecarbonshifters" on <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>, or send an email to <mailto: thecarbonshifters@gmail.com> with all your reference numbers. Later, we will set up a database where new members can register online <a href="link-to-database">database</a>, so your claim can later be verified on the ground <a href="link-to-clickable-map">by your local representative</a>. For further details on the georeference software check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code)

##  How do I claim my reimbursement?

Once you start burying charcoal, and create proof of that, you can claim your reimbursement. In order to give anyone a chance to verify that you REALLY did bury charcoal, you should first contact your local repesentative ("Carbon Contact") and tell them about this. It's easier for the CC if you do not bury charcoal alone but if many in your area do the same at the same time. Take short videos and upload them, e.g. at youtube or , or , or , and send the link to your Carbon Account.

If you can reliably prove how much charcoal you actually buried, you can claim your reimbursement from <a href="link-to-financial-contributors">people who want to pay for their CO2</a>.
